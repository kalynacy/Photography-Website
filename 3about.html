  <h1>About Olivia</h1>
     <p>Hi I'm Olivia! I'm a photographer based in New Orleans, Louisiana who specializes in documentary photography. I believe in capturing moments just as they are. There's nothing more exciting to me than capturing a true candid photo!</p>
       
    <p>I was first introduced to photography at the age of 12, during a summer beach vacation in Florida. I managed to sneak my moms digitial camera on the trip, and had an absolute blast capturing photos of the beautiful beach scenery. I put down the camera for a super time, <br>
     up until 2017, when I managed to snag a vintage film camera. Ever since discovering film, I've fallen in love with photography all over again! Since 2017, I've worked with my Canon AE-1 film camera, capturing special moments whenever and wherever I can!</p>

    <p>Some people wonder why I choose film over digital photography. I believe that film photography forces the photographer to slow down. When shooting with film, you have to be much more selective and deliberate in the process. With only so many shots in a roll, you have to make each one count! I guess at the end of the day film photography has my heart. No going back to digital land for me!</p>

    <p>When I don't have a camera in hand, you can find me enjoying a good book, playing with my two dogs, or on a travel adventure with my amazing fiance!</p>
